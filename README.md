Enables rudimentary use of midi keyboards with most music tracker programs. 


takes midi key on/off events and outputs qwerty keyboard presses based on the piano key mapping that most music tracker programs use.

there are 25 keys in range, since this is the range in which all the trackers I've tested are consistent,
and it corresponds nicely to the range of most 25-key midi keyboards.
